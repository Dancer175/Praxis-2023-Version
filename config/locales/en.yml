  poem: "Of course a human being is, only who believes in being human and then allows himself to be human._
        Sure that a human being will miss humanity, when the world forgets, that our true nature is to be human._
        Certain, however, that being human will win, if only we remember, that the force that unites us is love, because only love can lead us to freedom."

  mytherapydescription: "Medical massage specifically relieves tension, boosts circulation, stimulates the metabolism and has a calming effect on the organism._
                        Hawaiian Bodywork is a healing art that is thousands of years old and has been passed down through the generations from master to student. It is a combination of effective techniques to release tension in the body, and loving intention to bring body, soul and spirit back into harmony._
                        Both forms of therapy have given me valuable tools along the way. In my treatments, I combine the two concepts to apply the most effective techniques for each client's individual complaint."

  Claudia: "Claudia Haus"
  ClaudiaText: "Under the instruction of Claudia I was allowed to help in her natural healing practice and among other things perform foot reflexology massages. She gave me an incredible opportunity and allowed me to discover the joy of therapy. In the drugstore I got an insight into the world of natural remedies and could benefit from Claudia's extensive knowledge. In addition, she let me tinker for hours on new window display ideas for the drugstore. With scissors, glue and colored pencils. Our decorations were unique and very human, which inspired me."
  Juerg: "Jürg Schneeberger"
  JuergText: "As a boss and mentor, Jürg gave me the freedom to grow as a therapist. He taught me the down-to-earthness of the people of Emmental, a sense of separating the important from the unimportant, the work ethic of living what you preach, calmness and confidence in life. He also made me really aware of the importance of networked thinking as well as the inclusion of body statics when looking at a complaint. Jürg is an important role model for me as a therapist and as a person."
  Jeana: "Jeana Naluai"
  JeanaText: "Jeana has taught me interesting new therapeutic concepts by combining her experience as a physiotherapist with the knowledge of traditional Hawaiian healing and spirituality that has been passed on to her. Among others, the concept of Aloha (love, loving intention), Mana (power, energy), Pono (living and acting according to one's own moral principles), Ho'oponopono (bringing life circumstances and one's own moral principles back into harmony, forgiveness, clearing), Kuleana (taking responsibility for one's own life task). The holistic approach and treatment of an organism with gentle techniques for large-scale action on muscle tendon insertions, fascia, the nervous system and the lymphatic system met my need for rational explanations as well as my need for an intuitive approach. Jeana opened up a new world for me in Hawaii."
  Vision: "My Vision"

  # philosophy

  philosophytitle: "Philosophy"
  philosophycontent: "We are all HUMAN. No matter where we come from, how we look or what we believe in, what we do and represent in our lives._
                      FOR ME, being HUMAN means dancing with the wind and singing to the moon. To swim in a sea of emotions, to experience moments of perfection and clarity, to lose yourself to discover yourself anew. To be HUMAN means to cry, to laugh, to love. To think independently, to question and to speak one's personal truth. To be HUMAN means to allow yourself to be yourself. What does being HUMAN mean FOR YOU?_
                      It takes courage to be HUMAN. Because being HUMAN means being colorful in a sea of gray. To be different from everyone else, unique, an original instead of a copy._
                      Healing for me means to recognize this originality in ourselves and in our fellow human beings. To accept and live being human with all its facets. And to share our thoughts, feelings and stories with each other in order to grow together._
                      I wish that more and more PEOPLE have the courage to show their colors, to stand up for being human in love and respect, for our own good and for the good of our family, of HUMANITY."
